## Purpose
* This class is used for the simplification of representing positions on a chess board. Since the chess board in this example is represented by a 2d array, it is logical to represent piece positions as an x and y corresponding reference. The main uses for the coordinate class is to represent pieces at a specific location, wanted or possible piece movement locations, and pieces to destory.
## Important Notes
* An object of this class must be created by use of the appropriate Coordinate object name. The main uses of the Coordiante objects re to set and get x and y coordinates. x and y coordinates can be set by either the constructor or by the explicit set methods for both x and y.
