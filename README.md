## General Notes

* This repository is used to hold the files that encompass the Tergiverse Game.

* This program will have multiple stages of production represented by the following... 
* __Stage 1 Terminal Non-Opponent__ is the first and most simple implementation. It will be run through the Linux Command Line Interface and have no built in AI Opponent to face. It will be a turn based system. 
* __Stage 2 GUI Non-Opponent__ will be the next faze as the project will have an implemented GUI to provide better user interaction and use. 
* __Stage 3 GUI AI-Opponent__ will implement a simple machine AI opponent that can be played against. 
* __Stage 4 Algorithm Improvement and Review__ will be an overview of the project and review. It will include small minor fixes as well as major fixes such as fundemental data structures and algorithms. The entire backend game engine may be rewritten at this point. (In order to become a better programmer, I am starting out simple now and working my way up to more advanced implementation). 
* __Stage 5 Finalize and Publish__ the last stage will be polishing up any currently written features and adding small improvments.
